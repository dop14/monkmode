1. App's goal and idea behind it
The ultimate goal of monkmode is achieving a monk-like focus state, where you can maximize your deep work, by dividing your set focus goal into focus sessions, short breaks and long breaks.
Dividing your set focus goal into focus sessions, short breaks and long breaks, is a well known technique used by many high-achievers and students. By using focused bursts, 
you can maintain a higher concentration level, which in turn allows you to accomplish more.

2.What are focus periods
Focus periods - is the true essence of deep work. When you first run monkmode, the default focus period will be called "pomodoro". The "pomodoro" method is the most known focus
period out there. It divides the focus sessions into: 25 minutes of focus, then a 5 minute break. After completeing 4 focus sessions, the next break will be a "long break" which is usually 15 minutes.

  a. Creating a new focus period
  Monkmode allows you to create new focus periods, however you like them. You can customize your own period by setting a name for that perid, a focus time, and optionally choosing a short, and long break.

  b. Editing an existing focus period
  You can always edit previously created focus periods, or even the default "pomodoro" one. The edited focus period will always be the currently chosen focus period in the combobox.

  c. Deleting a focus period
  You can choose to delete any focus period, with the sole exception of the default one. Be aware that this action cannot be undone!

3. What are focus subjects
Focus subjects - are the topics you will be focusing on.

a. Creating a new focus subject
When creating a new focus subject you can be as detailed as you want to be. The only parameter to give here is the name of the topic you'd like to focus on.

b. Editing an existing focus subject
You can always edit previously created focus subjects, or even the default "study" one. The edited focus subject will always be the currently chosen focus subject in the combobox.

c. Archiving a focus subject
The idea behind archiving a focus subject is that whenever you're done with a topic (like your maths class in university, or you've completed your side project) you can set them aside without deleting them. 
This way it will still show up on your statistics menu. The default "study" focus subject can not be archived.

d. Deleting a focus subject
You can choose to delete any focus subject, with the sole exception of the default one. Be aware that this action cannot be undone, and this way you'll lose any progress linked to that focus subject.

4. How focus works
Starting a focus session couldn't be easier. First, you choose the focus period you'd like to use, and the subject, topic you'd like to focus on. Then you press "focus", and choose the number of focus sessions you'd like to have.
You'll see the total duration of the focus, aswell as the breakdown of it. Lastly you press "start focus", and the timer begins.

5. While in focus
   Every time a focus session starts, and everytime a break session starts, you'll hear a sound, both different, signaling the start of that particular session. There's a small pop-up text aswell in the bottom-left corner telling you
   if a focus session or a break session is about to start. These notifications (sound and pop-up) can be turned off in the settings menu.
   
   a. Pause, resume and stop
   While you're in focus, you can always pause, or stop the timer. Pausing the timer will freeze the countdown until you press resume. Stopping the focus session will completely stop the focus session. By confirming it, the focus will         end,but don't worry, any progress made will be saved aswell.

   b. Small view
   At the top-right corner, you can see a small icon, that will open up a small view version of monkmode. This can be used to see your progress while you're doing other tasks. Pause, resume and stop works exactly like previously explained.
   You can always go back to fullscreen view if you'd like to. If you find seeing the time remaining distracting, you can press "hide time" to hide it.

7. Daily focus goal
Your daily focus goal is the time spent in focus, that you'd like to complete each day. The minimum time is 1 hours. You can change your daily focus goal in the settings menu, which you'll see a bit later. By completeing your daily focus goal you'll earn streaks, which i'm sure most people are familiar with, but it will be explained too later on.

8. Action bar
At the top-left corner you can see all the options of the action bar.

   a. Settings
   In the settings menu you can change default values, choose to show or unshow the daily quote, or to turn off focus notifications.
   At the change default values menu you can choose the change the daily focus goal, the default period setting, and the default subject.
   Note that changing your daily focus goal after completing it will not affect that dayâ€™s completion status.
   The default period setting and subject are the ones that are chosen on default when you enter the app.

   b. Archive
   This is the place where you can see all of your archived subjects, and of course, you can unarchive them aswell.

   c. Help
   In the "help" menu, there's two options. One is "how to use", which will link to this README.md file you're currently reading. The other is "about", which contains basic information about the app, the developer, credits, the lincense       used.

9. Statistics
On the main page you can see the current week's focus time, and your current streak. If you press "show all", you can see more of these.

   
   




11. Basic statistics (explaining each statistics metric and how they work):
   a. total focus time
   b. avg focus time
   c. longest focus session
   d. focus sessions completed (Note: Focus sessions completed only counts if you complete the whole focus session, without stopping it.)
   e. daily goal achieved
   f. current streak and longest streak
   g. how karma (consistency works)
   h. how karma levels work (picture of levels)
12. Chart statistics
   a. daily focus line chart
   b. focus time distribution by subject
   c. focus time distribution by focus period
   d. focus time per subject
   e. focus timer per subject (all history)
