App's Goal and Idea Behind It

The ultimate goal of monkmode is to help you achieve a monk-like state of focus, allowing you to maximize deep work. It does this by breaking your overall focus goal into structured focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
This approach is a well-known technique used by high achievers and students alike. By working in focused bursts, you can maintain higher levels of concentration, which in turn helps you accomplish more.

2.What are focus periods
Focus periods - is the true essence of deep work. When you first run monkmode, the default focus period will be called "pomodoro". The "pomodoro" method is the most known focus
period out there. It divides the focus sessions into: 25 minutes of focus, then a 5 minute break. After completeing 4 focus sessions, the next break will be a "long break" which is usually 15 minutes.

  a. Creating a new focus period
  Monkmode allows you to create new focus periods, however you like them. You can customize your own period by setting a name for that perid, a focus time, and optionally choosing a short, and long break.

  b. Editing an existing focus period
  You can always edit previously created focus periods, or even the default "pomodoro" one. The edited focus period will always be the currently chosen focus period in the combobox.

  c. Deleting a focus period
  You can choose to delete any focus period, with the sole exception of the default one. Be aware that this action cannot be undone!

3. What are focus subjects
Focus subjects - are the topics you will be focusing on.

a. Creating a new focus subject
When creating a new focus subject you can be as detailed as you want to be. The only parameter to give here is the name of the topic you'd like to focus on.

b. Editing an existing focus subject
You can always edit previously created focus subjects, or even the default "study" one. The edited focus subject will always be the currently chosen focus subject in the combobox.

c. Archiving a focus subject
The idea behind archiving a focus subject is that whenever you're done with a topic (like your maths class in university, or you've completed your side project) you can set them aside without deleting them. 
This way it will still show up on your statistics menu. The default "study" focus subject can not be archived.

d. Deleting a focus subject
You can choose to delete any focus subject, with the sole exception of the default one. Be aware that this action cannot be undone, and this way you'll lose any progress linked to that focus subject.

4. How focus works
Starting a focus session couldn't be easier. First, you choose the focus period you'd like to use, and the subject, topic you'd like to focus on. Then you press "focus", and choose the number of focus sessions you'd like to have.
You'll see the total duration of the focus, aswell as the breakdown of it. Lastly you press "start focus", and the timer begins.

5. While in focus
   Every time a focus session starts, and everytime a break session starts, you'll hear a sound, both different, signaling the start of that particular session. There's a small pop-up text aswell in the bottom-left corner telling you
   if a focus session or a break session is about to start. These notifications (sound and pop-up) can be turned off in the settings menu.
   
   a. Pause, resume and stop
   While you're in focus, you can always pause, or stop the timer. Pausing the timer will freeze the countdown until you press resume. Stopping the focus session will completely stop the focus session. By confirming it, the focus will         end,but don't worry, any progress made will be saved aswell.

   b. Small view
   At the top-right corner, you can see a small icon, that will open up a small view version of monkmode. This can be used to see your progress while you're doing other tasks. Pause, resume and stop works exactly like previously explained.
   You can always go back to fullscreen view if you'd like to. If you find seeing the time remaining distracting, you can press "hide time" to hide it.

7. Daily focus goal
Your daily focus goal is the time spent in focus, that you'd like to complete each day. The minimum time is 1 hours. You can change your daily focus goal in the settings menu, which you'll see a bit later. By completeing your daily focus goal you'll earn streaks, which i'm sure most people are familiar with, but it will be explained too later on.

8. Action bar
At the top-left corner you can see all the options of the action bar.

   a. Settings
   In the settings menu you can change default values, choose to show or unshow the daily quote, or to turn off focus notifications.
   At the change default values menu you can choose the change the daily focus goal, the default period setting, and the default subject.
   Note that changing your daily focus goal after completing it will not affect that dayâ€™s completion status.
   The default period setting and subject are the ones that are chosen on default when you enter the app.

   b. Archive
   This is the place where you can see all of your archived subjects, and of course, you can unarchive them aswell.

   c. Help
   In the "help" menu, there's two options. One is "how to use", which will link to this README.md file you're currently reading. The other is "about", which contains basic information about the app, the developer, credits, the lincense       used.

9. Statistics
On the main page you can see the current week's time spent in focus, and your current streak. If you press "show all", you can see more data.

a. Focus statistics
These focus statistics speaks for themselves. 
One thing to note is that "focus sessions completed" only counts if you've completed that whole focus sessions (meaning you didn't stop it).

b. Streak & Karma statistics
- The daily goal achieved showed how many times you've hit your daily goal.
- The current streak shows your most recent, current streak.
How streak works: Streaks on the weekdays are strict, meaning that if you have don't complete your daily focus goal on any weekday, your streak will reset to 0.
However, on weekends, its optional. If you choose to complete your daily focus goal, then your streak will be added, if you don't complete it, then the streak won't reset to 0.
- The longest streak shows your all time longest streak.
- Karma is a metric that shows your consistency over the past 3 months.
How karma is calculcated: karma = (completed_days / relevant_days * 100). Completed days are the number of days you've completed your daily focus goal. Relevant days are the number of weekdays in the past 3 months, plus the number of weekend days where you've completed your daily focus goal.
- Karma levels shows your current "monk status" in your focus journey. There are 7 different karma levels for you to achieve, but i won't spoil them here, that's your job to discover.

c. Charts
After completeing atleast one focus session, you'll see 5 different charts in the statistics window.
- The first one is a line chart that shows your daily focus time in the last 30 days. With this you can see the ups and downs of your focus time.
- The second on is a pie chart that shows how your focus is distributed by the subjects in the last 30 days. 
- The third is a pie chart aswell that shows how your focus is distributed by the period setting in the last 30 days.
- The fourth is a bar chart, that shows the focus time per subject in the last 30 days.
- The last, fifth is a bar chart aswell, that works exactly like the previous chart, but not in the last 30 days, but all history. You can select to see, or unsee the archived subjects aswell.
   

With this, i think we've gone over everything that is important. If you have any questions feel free to ask them in the github repo.
Happy focusing! - dop14
