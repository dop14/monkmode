1. App's goal and idea behind it
The ultimate goal of monkmode is achieving a monk-like focus state, where you can maximize your deep work, by dividing your set focus goal into focus sessions, short breaks and long breaks.
Dividing your set focus goal into focus sessions, short breaks and long breaks, is a well known technique used by many high-achievers and students. By using focused bursts, 
you can maintain a higher concentration level, which in turn allows you to accomplish more.

2.What are focus periods
Focus periods - is the true essence of deep work. When you first run monkmode, the default focus period will be called "pomodoro". The "pomodoro" method is the most known focus
period out there. It divides the focus sessions into: 25 minutes of focus, then a 5 minute break. After completeing 4 focus sessions, the next break will be a "long break" which is usually 15 minutes.

  a. Creating a new focus period
  Monkmode allows you to create new focus periods, however you like them. You can customize your own period by setting a name for that perid, a focus time, and optionally choosing a short, and long break.

  b. Editing an existing focus period
  You can always edit previously created focus periods, or even the default "pomodoro" one. The edited focus period will always be the currently chosen focus period in the combobox.

  c. Deleting a focus period
  You can choose to delete any focus period, with the sole exception of the default one. Be aware that this action cannot be undone!

3. What are focus subjects
Focus subjects - are the topics you will be focusing on.

a. Creating a new focus subject
When creating a new focus subject you can be as detailed as you want to be. The only parameter to give here is the name of the topic you'd like to focus on.

b. Editing an existing focus subject
You can always edit previously created focus subjects, or even the default "study" one. The edited focus subject will always be the currently chosen focus subject in the combobox.
