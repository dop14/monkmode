Archiving subjects
    If user focused on a project, but the project is done, he could perhaps archive it.
    Settings -> Archived subjects -> See archived / Unarchive
    Unarchived wont show in combobox

When deleting subject: 
    Deleting this subject will stop tracking any new focus time for it. Past focus time data will remain, but you wonâ€™t be able to add more.
