UI:
Icons instead of text:

UX:
focus window:
    Focus will approximately end on 12:45 (update every minute)

When focus period started: Focus period(1 out of 6), Break (1 of 5)

When adding, updating, deleting pop-up message:
    Added XY period setting / subject
    Updated XY period setting / subject
    Deleted XY period setting / subject

Edit, Add window:
    - bold default period, subject

Archiving subjects
    If user focused on a project, but the project is done, he could perhaps archive it.
    Settings -> Archived subjects -> See archived / Unarchive
    Unarchived wont show in combobox

When deleting subject: 
    Deleting this subject will stop tracking any new focus time for it. Past focus time data will remain, but you wonâ€™t be able to add more.
