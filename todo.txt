ARCHIVING:
- If user focused on a project, but the project is done, he could perhaps archive it.
- Settings -> Archived subjects -> See archived / Unarchive
- Archived wont show in combobox
- Unarchived will go back to combobox



TIPS AND QUOTES
- Monkmode philosophy (deep work, focus, zen, monklike)
- Tips for breaks are only showed when in a break
- When in focus, there's no noise, or quotes whatsoever
- Daily quotes, choosing randomly, showing up one everyday (resets at 00:00)

DESIGN:
- only one premade theme
- Icons instead of text
- Deleting this subject will stop tracking any new focus time for it. If you might use it later, use Archive instead of Delete.
- When adding, updating, deleting pop-up notification message:
    Added XY period setting / subject
    Updated XY period setting / subject
    Deleted XY period setting / subject

ELSE TODO:
- Stats for later: TABLE where (daily focus goal achieved 134 times, weekly focus goal achieved 13 times,...,...,) store data
- Run db_manager.py automatically when the user enters the app
- Streaks (history: longest streak, last active streak,...)
