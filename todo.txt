DESIGN:
- only one premade theme
- choose font
- Icons instead of text (tootlips for icon texts)
- Deleting this subject will stop tracking any new focus time for it. If you might use it later, use Archive instead of Delete.
- When adding, updating, deleting pop-up notification message:
    Added XY period setting / subject
    Updated XY period setting / subject
    Deleted XY period setting / subject






TIPS AND QUOTES
- Monkmode philosophy (deep work, focus, zen, monklike)
- Tips for breaks are only showed when in a break
- When in focus, there's no noise, or quotes whatsoever
- Daily quotes, choosing randomly, showing up one everyday (resets at 00:00)

ELSE TODO:
- little window with timer if user clicks on it (hide main window, show little window with function to hide timer)
- Stats for later: TABLE where (daily focus goal achieved 134 times, weekly focus goal achieved 13 times,...,...,) store data
- Run db_manager.py automatically when the user enters the app
- Streaks (history: longest streak, last active streak,...)
