TEST STREAK LOGIC: IF LOGIC ADDS UP CORRECTLY, IF YOU COMPLETE THE GOAL TODAY

 2 diagrams:
 1st - daily focus linechart in the past 30 days
 2nd - pie chart from subjects (50% - study, 25% - work, 25% - reading)
 3rd - see how much time i spent on each subject

 
Heatmap:
- user can scroll through a heatmap history (like on github)
- days where there was no focus will show with grey
- days where there was focus but the goal was not achieved will show with orange
- days where there was focus and goal was achieved will show with blue
- each day is clickable (pop-up window)
    - show the focus time that day
    - the most focused subject that day
    - the state of the daily goal that day
    - the most used period setting that day
