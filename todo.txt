Add show time function logic
small window tooltips not working

ELSE TODO:
- Stats for later (stats table): TABLE where (daily focus goal achieved 134 times, weekly focus goal achieved 13 times,...,...,) store data
- Run db_manager.py automatically when the user enters the app
- db backup
- what if db changes (migration for users)
- Circular progress bar around the timer label


DESIGN:
- Choose color palette
- change icons
- CIRCLE PROGRESSION BAR TO TIMER (SEE HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT)

The data shown to the user:
- daily goal achieved
- weekly goal achieved
- current KARMA
- longest KARMA
- total focus sessions completed
- total time focused
- most focused subject
- whatever the user picks to see


CREATE TABLE stats IF NOT EXISTS (
    daily_goal_achieved: 5 times, (only once a day can be added (if user hits 100 percent, but decides to change dafault daily goal
    so that it wont be 100% no more, than its still saved  as achieved daily goal))
    weekly_goal_achieved: 4 times,  
    ...
)
