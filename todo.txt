Focus sessions duration -> TIME SPENT IN FOCUS, WITHOUT BREAKS

Timer.py
    Count the number of sessions left:
    Example: Pomodoro default
    Start: sessions_left = 6, short_break_time = 5, long_break_time = 15, long_break_after = 4, is_long_break = 0
    
    focus_timer()
    def start_focus_timer():
        If focus_time == 0:
            sessions_left--
            is_long_break++
            save_session_to_database()

            if long_break_after == is_long_break
                Start long break
                is_long_break = 0
            Else
                Start short break
        
    def
        elif focus_time_paused == True:
            pause_timer()

            if focus_time_paused == False:
                continue_timer()

        elif focus_time_stopped == True:
            show_confirmation_window() -> do you really want to stop the focus session? Time in focus will be saved
            stop_focus_time() -> save current time to db



    Start session based on period_setting and user_sessions
        Hide FOCUS button
        Show pause/resume and reset button
        Show time left
            Update it every second

    After session ends/stopped/app closed:
        save to focus_sessions in db
        update today's focus, this week's focus
        update daily focus goal label, weekly focus label
        update daily focus goal, weekly focus goal progression bar


Create schema for focus goal
    - daily focus goal default: 1 hour
    - weekly focus goal default: (weekdays || whole week) * daily focus goal

Default: weekdays only
