Delete weekly progress, show statistics instead
BUTTON: show all -> opens a new window with statistics




ELSE TODO:
- Stats for later (stats table): TABLE where (daily focus goal achieved 134 times, weekly focus goal achieved 13 times,...,...,) store data
- Run db_manager.py automatically when the user enters the app
- db backup
- what if db changes (migration for users)
- Circular progress bar around the timer label
- save small focus window's last location?
- delete history

KARMA - works exactly like streaks
- user can toggle -> show karma or unshow karma
- refactor set week
- karma points
- karma levels


The data shown to the user:
- daily goal achieved
- total focus sessions completed
- total time focused
- most focused subject
- whatever the user picks to see
